One of my main areas of interest is **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
I’m deeply fascinated by the process of designing intelligent systems that not only mimic human thinking but also extend beyond it.

My ultimate goal is to integrate AI across various fields to create new value and meaningful innovation.  
I believe that AI technology is more than just algorithms — it is a tool capable of solving complex, real-world problems.

In particular, I have a strong interest in **autonomous driving technology**, where AI acts as the “eyes” and “brain” of a vehicle, enabling it to perceive, decide, and learn on its own.  
To achieve this, I continuously study **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **sensor fusion**, and **computer vision** technologies.

I view autonomous driving not merely as a technological challenge but as a revolution that transforms how humans move.  
I aspire to be at the center of this innovation — contributing to the advancement of AI-driven mobility systems.

Ultimately, my dream is to help build a future where AI seamlessly connects with transportation, logistics, and urban infrastructure to bring safer and more efficient changes to people’s everyday lives.
