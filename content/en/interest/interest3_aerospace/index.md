I believe that **aerospace** is the field that best embodies humanity’s spirit of challenge — the drive to push beyond technological limits and explore new worlds.

I aim to combine this spirit with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to conduct forward-looking research in areas such as **autonomous flight systems**, **space exploration automation**, and **aerospace data analysis**.

My goal is to help AI evolve beyond a simple data-processing tool,  
into an **intelligent system capable of learning and making decisions independently**, even in space environments.

Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to the **fusion of AI and aerospace technology**,  
laying the foundation for humanity to reach farther into the universe and explore a broader future.
