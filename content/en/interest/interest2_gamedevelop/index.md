I have a deep passion for **software development**, especially **game development**.

Beyond simply writing code, I’m fascinated by the process of creating **immersive and enjoyable experiences** centered around **user experience (UX)** — designing and implementing services that people can truly engage with and enjoy.

Having explored both **front-end** and **back-end** development, I aspire to experience the full process of turning an idea into a complete, functional product.  
My goal is to manage the entire journey — from the birth of an idea to delivering a finished service that provides real value to users.

Another goal of mine is to integrate **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** into game development, enabling more **intelligent** and **personalized** gameplay experiences.

Ultimately, I want to become a developer who not only focuses on the technical completeness of a game but also creates joy, immersion, and memorable experiences for people.
