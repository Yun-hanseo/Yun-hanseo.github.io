<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.8;">
  Ever since I was young, Iâ€™ve loved drawing so much that I once dreamed of becoming an artist.  
  Although I donâ€™t draw as often these days, during elementary, middle, and high school I would always draw whenever I had free time.  
  When I draw, hours pass by in the blink of an eye â€” I can fully concentrate on it without any distractions.<br>
  However, I eventually gave up on the dream of becoming an artist, realizing there were many people who were far more talented than me.

      Drawing is not just a simple hobby for me â€” itâ€™s a way to express my emotions.  
      The greatest charm of drawing is the ability to lose track of time and completely immerse myself in the process.
