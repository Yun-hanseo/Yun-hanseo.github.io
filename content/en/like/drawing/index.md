**▲ “He Was Cool” by Guiyeoni**
Drawing is the most natural way for me to visually express my thoughts and emotions.
I especially enjoy looking at other people’s artwork and recreating it in my own style.

Through the process of drawing, I experience both deep immersion and a sense of calm, allowing me to understand myself more profoundly.
