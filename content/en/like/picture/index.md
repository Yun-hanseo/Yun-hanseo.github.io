Photography, to me, is more than just a hobby — it’s a way to express and capture the emotions of everyday life.
<br>
I especially enjoy using the atmosphere of nature and the city to create warm and sentimental images.
<br>
Among natural subjects, I particularly love taking photos of the sea. Since my hometown is Busan, I’ve had many chances to see the ocean, and the night view of Gwangalli Beach is truly beautiful.
<br>
Through my photos, I aim to evoke the same emotions in others that I felt when I took them.
