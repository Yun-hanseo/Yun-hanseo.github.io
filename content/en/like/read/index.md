When I was young, I didn’t particularly enjoy reading books.  
However, as time went by, I came to realize the importance of reading and started building the habit of reading regularly.  
At first, even reading for ten minutes felt difficult, but as I got used to it, it gradually increased to thirty minutes and even an hour.<br><br>
Through reading, I was able to clear my mind of distractions and imagine the scenes vividly in my head.  
I also enjoyed the feeling of learning things I didn’t know before.  
Reading has allowed me to broaden my perspective on the world and develop deeper thinking skills.  
In particular, I enjoy reading humanities books to deepen my understanding of people and society.
