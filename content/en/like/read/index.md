**▲ *No Longer Human* by Osamu Dazai**<br>

When I was young, I didn’t really enjoy reading books, but as time went by, I began to realize the importance of reading and started to build a reading habit.
At first, even reading for ten minutes felt very difficult, but as I got used to it, the time gradually increased to thirty minutes, then an hour.
While reading, I enjoyed clearing my mind of unnecessary thoughts and visualizing the scenes and ideas that the book described.
<br>
I also liked the feeling of learning things I didn’t know before through books.
Reading has allowed me to broaden my perspective on the world and develop deeper, more thoughtful ways of thinking.
<br>
In particular, I enjoy reading books on the humanities, as they help me better understand people and society.
I find inspiration in the words within books and try to naturally incorporate that inspiration into my life and my work.
