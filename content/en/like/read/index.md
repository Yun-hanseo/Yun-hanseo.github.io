**â–² *No Longer Human* by Osamu Dazai**
Reading is, for me, the most certain way to broaden my thinking and gain new perspectives.
Through books from various fields, I expand the way I see the world and cultivate deeper, more reflective thinking.

I especially enjoy reading humanities books, as they help me better understand people and society.
I draw inspiration from meaningful sentences in books and naturally weave those insights into my life and work.
