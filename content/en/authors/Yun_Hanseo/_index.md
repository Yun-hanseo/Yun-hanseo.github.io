I’m **Hanseo Yun**, a sophomore majoring in **Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **Jeonbuk National University (JBNU)**.  
Beyond simple curiosity, I’m deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence, Aerospace, and Software Development**.

In the field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, I constantly explore ways to build intelligent systems that emulate and even surpass human thinking.  
My interests include **machine learning**, **deep learning–based predictive models**, **natural language processing**, and **autonomous systems**.  
I find the greatest fulfillment in understanding the world through data and solving real problems.

In **Aerospace**, I’m fascinated by humanity’s endless challenge to push beyond technological boundaries and explore new worlds.  
I dream of integrating AI technology into aviation and space systems — developing autonomous flight, space exploration automation, and intelligent data analysis for future-oriented research.

Finally, **software development** is the foundation of my passion.  
Rather than merely writing code, I strive to create better user experiences and meaningful digital services.
