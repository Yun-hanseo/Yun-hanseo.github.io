          Hello ðŸ˜Š
          <b>Jeonbuk National University, School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence</b> ðŸŽ“

          Iâ€™m Hanseo Yun, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University.
          I have a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Aerospace, and Game Development.

          Through AI, I aim to design intelligent systems that mimic and extend human thinking,
          and ultimately contribute to the advancement of autonomous flight and space exploration technologies.
          In addition, I aspire to create immersive and creative experiences through game development.

          My ultimate goal is to become a developer who applies AI technology in real-world fields to make meaningful innovations. âœ¨
